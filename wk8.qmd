## Summary

A continuation of last week's look into the classification of remotely sensed imaging, we focused this weekend on a handful of more advanced methods, with a particular focus on determining the accuracy of classifications. I will briefly touch on some of those methods before taking the majority of the summary to talk about accuracy asssement
