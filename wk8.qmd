## Summary

A continuation of last week's look into the classification of remotely sensed imaging, we focused this weekend on a handful of more advanced methods, with a particular focus on determining the accuracy of classifications. I will briefly touch on some of those methods before taking the majority of the summary to talk about accuracy asssement

### Object Based Image Analysis

Object based image analysis is a method of for analysing remotely sensed data at the multi-pixel or 'superpixel' level by identifying discrete physical objects (buildings, small bodies of water, fields, etc...) which can then be classified at object level as opposed to considering pixels in isolation [@blaschke2010]. The most common way of doing this is an algorithm known as Simple Liear Iterative Clustering, which partitions the image into a grid before iteratively moving the centre of each cell to best capture the pixels which are most homogeneous with the rest of the chunk, in a manner similar to k-means clustering [@achanta2012]. This algorithm attempts to keep objects both spatially and spectrally compact, meaning they retain consistent appearance and a small physical distance from end to end.
