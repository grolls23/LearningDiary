## Summary

This week, we discussed the pre-processing steps that allow us to turn raw remotely sensed data into a product which we can use for analysis. The processing requirements we described fell into two categories which will be detailed below.

### **Corrections**

A number of types of distortions can occur which can alter where artefacts on the ground are placed in relation to each other or how radiation measured at the satellite differs from conditions at the surface. The main subcategories of distortions and primary methods to correct for them are briefly described here:

**Geometric Correction:** The viewing angle of a satellite to the point on Earth's surface being photographed can cause distortions in the resulting images, arising from inconsistent perspectives. Ideally, a satellite will be at the local zenith (directly above) of the point on Earth being imaged, but this is not always the case. Correcting for this specific type of distortion is known as orthorectification, where images are corrected to appear as if they were taken from nadir (straight down).

Similar distortions can occur as a result of the Earth's topography or from the rotation of the earth moving the ground underneath the satellite as it orbits.

To apply a geometric correction, reference points (called ground control points) are matched between the collected image and a 'ground truth' dataset of the surface. From there, a linear regression model is generated and a geometric transformation applied to each point in the image.

**Atmospheric Correction:** Interference from Earth's atmosphere such as cloud cover atmospheric scattering, can cause radiation reflected from Earth's surface to be distorted or obscured entirely. Atmospheric corrections can be either relative, in that they normalise pixels relative to other points in the image (e.g. a regression based on pseudo-invariant features, points which are likely to be consistent in their reflective properties), or absolute where atmospheric models are used to correct for specific atmospheric conditions.

**Radiometric Calibration:** Although not image 'correction', radiometric calibration refers to converting the brightness of specific pixels (stored as a unitless digital number by the satellite) into radiance, which is a specific measure of radiative intensity.

Fortunately for professionals (or hobbyists) using remote sensing imagery, level two products can be downloaded for most sensor platforms. A level two product refers to data that has already been pre-processed to correct for many of the distortions described
