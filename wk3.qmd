## Summary

This week, we discussed the pre-processing steps that allow us to turn raw remotely sensed data into a product which we can use for analysis. The processing requirements we described fell into two categories which will be detailed below.

### **Corrections**

A number of types of distortions can occur which can alter where artefacts on the ground are placed in relation to each other or how radiation
