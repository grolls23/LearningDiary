## Summary

After the a week off from class, we were introduced to Google Earth Engine, the platform for remotely sensed data analysis which we will make our home for the remainder of the course. The number of specific tools and operations we learned about in Earth Engine is too great to share concisely in this learning diary format. For that reason, I will focus on what Earth Engine is and what makes it both unique and powerful as a spatial analysis platform.

### What is Earth Engine?

Google Earth Engine is a high-performance geospatial analysis tool, with a particular focus on remote sensing, which was developed to allow researchers and other professionals to use high performance computing technologies in their work without requiring the requisite IT skill which has been required to take advantage of these resources in the past [@gorelickGoogleEarthEngine2017]. The nature of remotely sensed data - raster datasets covering large expanses of the world's surface - requires large computing resources to process at scale.

Earth Engine satisfies these computational requirements by utilising a technique called parallel computing, wherein computationally intensive tasks are split into independent sub-tasks and processed simultaneously on multiple CPUs [@gorelickGoogleEarthEngine2017]. The core idea behind the application's architecture then, is that processing happens server-side instead of on a local machine as GIS programmes have typically required. Users interface with Earth Engine using JavaScript or Python-enabled libraries.

In addition to reducing the local computational power required to efficiently utilise remotely sensed data, Earth Engine claims its other distinct advantage as that of data access and management. Google provides a 'data catalogue' which contains petabytes of the most commonly used (and arguably important) remotely sensed datasets available [@campos-tabernerGlobalEstimationBiophysical2018]. In addition to being constantly updated, this catalogue also includes historical readings from many satellite platforms which, when combined with the use of the aforementioned parallel processing paradigm, makes temporal analysis of RS data much easier [@campos-tabernerGlobalEstimationBiophysical2018].

## Applications in Research

Google Earth Engine has seen increasingly wide use in recent years, although the most common characteristics of its applications, per @tamiminiaGoogleEarthEngine2020 are:

1.  The use of multi-temporal data
2.  Use of data from optical sensor platforms, particularly Landsat and MODIS
3.  Applications with a particular focus on phenoma in the natural environment.

In particular, products like NDVI, land-cover, and forest change datasets were used in a substantial number of applications. Additionally, the application of machine learning techniques is becoming increasingly common [@tamiminiaGoogleEarthEngine2020].

With that said, the two applications I'd like to further investigate are
