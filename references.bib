	abstract = {Small swath and coarse temporal resolution are the major limitations of high resolution satellite sensors for applications like monitoring large areas within limited period of time interval. In general, higher the spatial resolution smaller is the swath and coarser is the temporal resolution. In order to overcome this constraint, sensors are equipped with the capability to tilt from nominal nadir viewing to the required direction. When user specified area is difficult to acquire using Nadir viewing, Off-nadir viewing is exercised by tilting the platform/sensor to the required area.A study was carried out on off-nadir viewing effects in terms of radiometry and geometry using high resolution data. The parameters considered were (a) quality of resultant mosaic images (b) variations in the spatial resolutions (c) variations in the radiometry from the images acquired with various amount of tilts over different types of terrains. This paper aims to bring out the effects on the geometric and radiometric data quality and usability of value-added products generated from off-nadir high resolution data by analyzing existing {IRS}-Carto2S data. The observations drawn are useful for operating future {IRS} {HR} satellites to supply high quality products to the user community.},

	abstract = {Urban geographical maps are important to urban planning, urban construction, land-use studies, disaster control and relief, touring and sightseeing, and so on. Satellite remote sensing images are the most important data source for urban geographical maps. However, for optical satellite remote sensing images with high spatial resolution, certain inevitable factors, including cloud, haze, and cloud shadow, severely degrade the image quality. Moreover, the geometrical and radiometric differences amongst multiple high-spatial-resolution images are difficult to eliminate. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient procedure for generating high-resolution and high-quality seamless satellite imagery for large-scale urban regions. This procedure consists of image registration, cloud detection, thin/thick cloud removal, pansharpening, and mosaicking processes. Methodologically, a spatially adaptive method considering the variation of atmospheric scattering, and a stepwise replacement method based on local moment matching are proposed for removing thin and thick clouds, respectively. The effectiveness is demonstrated by a successful case of generating a 0.91-m-resolution image of the main city zone in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, using images obtained from the Chinese Beijing-2 and Gaofen-2 high-resolution satellites.},

This provides the capability to collect dozens of multiangle very high spatial resolution images over a large target area during a single overflight. In addition, {WorldView}-2 collects eight bands of multispectral data. This paper discusses the improvements in urban classification accuracy available through utilization of the spatial and spectral information from a {WorldView}-2 multiangle image sequence collected over Atlanta, {GA}, in December 2009. Specifically, the implications of adding height data and multiangle multispectral reflectance, both derived from the multiangle sequence, to the textural, morphological, and spectral information of a single {WorldView}-2 image are investigated. The results show an improvement in classification accuracy of 27\% and 14\% for the spatial and spectral experiments, respectively. Additionally, the multiangle data set allows the differentiation of classes not typically well identified by a single image, such as skyscrapers and bridges as well as flat and pitched roofs.},

	abstract = {A fusion based seamless mosaic method for stitching remote sensing images is introduced in this paper. The proposed method focuses on one major problem in the process of mosaic: how to generate visually pleasant stitching result in the cases of misalignment, global and local intensity differences between images. First, two partially overlapped images are decomposed into high-frequency components and low-frequency components with Gaussian low-pass filter. Second, by considering the information characteristics contained in both separated components, different mosaic schemes are designed to accomplish stitching process accordingly. For the low-frequency components consisting of coarse shape and illumination information, two-dimension weighted blending rule is utilized to achieve smoothing transition. For the high-frequency components including rich details, an improved seam searching strategy based on dynamic programming is introduced. With the obtained stitching seam guiding the stitching process, visible structural break can be avoided. Finally, the mosaic result is produced by linearly composing both stitching results of different components together. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating seamless mosaic results without introducing any unexpected blurring or artifacts.},

This is an important oversight because policy and technology are often developed in isolation of each other and not in conjunction. Therefore, they have limited synergistic effects when aimed at solving global issues. To examine this aspect, we conducted a systematic literature review and synthesised 97 articles to create a conceptual structuring of the topic. We identified the following categories: (a) evidence base for policymaking including timescale analysis, effective policymaking instruments as well as decision support and scenario planning; (b) policy responses including landscape and urban form, green and blue area ratio, albedo enhancement policies, transport modal split as well as public health and participation; (c) passive technologies including green building envelopes and development of cool surfaces; and (d) active technologies including sustainable transport as well as energy consumption, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and waste heat. Based on the findings, we present a framework to guide future research in analysing {UHI} policy and technology responses more effectively in conjunction with each other.},

The objective of this work is to investigate the sensitivities of urban flooding to urban land growth through simulation of flood flows under different urbanization conditions and during different flooding stages. A sub-watershed in Toronto, Canada, with urban land conversion was selected as a test site for this study. In order to investigate the effects of urbanization on changes in urban flood risk, land use maps from six different years (1966, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, and 2000) and of six simulated land use scenarios (0\%, 20\%, 40\%, 60, 80\%, and 100\% impervious surface area percentages) were input into coupled hydrologic and hydraulic models. The results show that urbanization creates higher surface runoff and river discharge rates and shortened times to achieve the peak runoff and discharge. Areas influenced by flash flood and floodplain increases due to urbanization are related not only to overall impervious surface area percentage but also to the spatial distribution of impervious surface coverage. With similar average impervious surface area percentage, land use with spatial variation may aggravate flash flood conditions more intensely compared to spatially uniform land use distribution.},

	abstract = {Urban Heat Islands ({UHIs}) impact the quality of life in many urban centres. Metropolitan areas of Australian cities and urbanised regional centres, in particular, show vulnerability towards {UHIs} due to challenging climatic conditions and the model of greater subdivision of established properties whereby backyards and mature trees are replaced with more residential dwellings and sealed areas. The measurements for the {UHI} mitigation, such as imposing reforestation, employing sustainable and medium density housing build form typology must be quantified. Simulation-based identification and mitigation of {UHIs} can be used for planning decisions. There are several advantages to use simulations. For instance, alternative subdivision design, building design and the placement of trees and other measures is only required in the digital twin. Experimenting with the digital twin saves resources and maximises the outcome by being able to quantify the heat reduction. The aim of this work is to quantify the impact of the current urban infill methods on {UHI}. We focus on an area that has gone through a process of re-subdivision that is bounded by roads within Perth, Western Australia. For the same area we propose an alternative design with an urban infill model based on a medium density housing guidelines with an improved green space allocation. While the current model shows significant effects of {UHIs} we could mitigate those effects in the alternative proposed model. In our simulation the hottest surfaces are roads with a temperature of approximately 45\&thinsp;\&deg;C at 2PM in the afternoon. In the current model close to 100\% of the road surfaces reach this temperature. In contrast, in the alternative model only 45\% of all road surfaces reach this temperature, significantly reducing the impact of {UHI} for pedestrian walking close by to those roads. At 2PM, the most frequent temperature of all surfaces for the current model is around 44\&thinsp;\&deg;C while the alternative’s model the most frequent temperature is approximately 28\&thinsp;\&deg;C – a difference of 16\&thinsp;\&deg;C.},

	abstract = {Urban sprawl is considered by most environmental scientists and urban planners to be a serious environmental problem. However, public perception about parking availability often forces planning offices to recommend parking lot sizes that exceed daily demands. The recent trend of increasing the size of stores, churches and even schools comes with increasing the size of parking lots that service these buildings. The objective of this paper is to analyze space allocation of parking lots in a typical midwestern county and to estimate the supply of parking spaces to potential demand. We also estimate the loss of ecosystem services represented by the area of parking lots in this county. We found that parking lots cover 5.65km2 (1 397acres) of Tippecanoe County, Indiana which implies that 0.44\% of the county area is devoted to parking lots. Our results show that there are approximately 2.2 parking spaces per registered vehicle, that parking lots make up more than 6.57\% of the total urban footprint in this county, that the area of parking lots exceeded the area of parks in the city limits by a factor of three and that parking lot runoff and pollutants are significant compared to runoff and pollutants from these areas prior to their conversion to parking lots. As other authors have done before us we lament the poor use of land in urban regions of the United States, and encourage planners to think creatively about the use of land for parking.},

	abstract = {It is imperative to quantitatively analyze the long-term temporal and spatial characteristics of the urban heat island ({UHI}) effect on cities for applications, such as urban expansion and environmental protection. Owing to the high spatial resolution and availability of long time-series data, remote sensing images from Landsat satellites are widely used for land surface temperature ({LST}) retrieval. However, limited by the satellite revisit cycle and image quality, the use of multisource Landsat images in a long-term study of the {UHI} effect is inevitable. Nonetheless, owing to the differences among multisource sensors, such as Landsat-7 and Landsat-8, there may be apparent deviations in the {LST} results retrieved from different sensor data, which are obtained from the same area and under similar circumstances. Consequently, it is necessary to build a relationship between the {LST} results generated from multisource Landsat sensors for future research on the {UHI} effect. In this study, Shenzhen city was studied to explore the fitting relationship between the corresponding {LST} products from Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 images obtained from adjacent dates with similar climatic conditions. Furthermore, factors affecting the fitting models, such as land cover types, seasonal and inter-annual differences, were analyzed. The constructed fitting model had a strong relationship with land cover types but a relatively weak relationship with seasonal and inter-annual differences; this indicates that a pseudo Landsat-8-based {LST} product can be generated from a Landsat-7-based {LST} product using a model fitted by a Landsat-7/8 pair obtained from adjacent years (or different seasons). Finally, by considering the consistency between {LST} products from multisource Landsat images, the spatiotemporal variations in the {UHI} effect in Shenzhen can be accurately explored using long time-series data.},

	abstract = {Accurately mapping impervious-surface dynamics has great scientific significance and application value for research on urban sustainable development, the assessment of anthropogenic carbon emissions and global ecological-environment modeling. In this study, a novel and automatic method of combining the advantages of spectral-generalization and automatic-sample-extraction strategies was proposed, and then an accurate global 30 m impervious-surface dynamic dataset ({GISD}30) for 1985 to 2020 was produced using time-series Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. Firstly, the global training samples and corresponding reflectance spectra were automatically derived from prior global 30 m land-cover products after employing the multitemporal compositing method and relative radiometric normalization. Then, spatiotemporal adaptive classification models, trained with the migrated reflectance spectra of impervious surfaces from 2020 and transferred pervious-surface samples in each epoch for every 5∘×5∘ geographical tile, were applied to map the impervious surface in each period. Furthermore, a spatiotemporal-consistency correction method was presented to minimize the effects of independent classification errors and improve the spatiotemporal consistency of impervious-surface dynamics. Our global 30 m impervious-surface dynamic model achieved an overall accuracy of 90.1 \% and a kappa coefficient of 0.865 using 23 322 global time-series validation samples. Cross-comparisons with five existing global 30 m impervious-surface products further indicated that our {GISD}30 dynamic product achieved the best performance in capturing the spatial distributions and spatiotemporal dynamics of impervious surfaces in various impervious landscapes. The statistical results indicated that the global impervious surface has doubled in the past 35 years, from 5.116×105 km2 in 1985 to 10.871×105 km2 in 2020, and Asia saw the largest increase in impervious surface area compared to other continents, with a total increase of 2.946×105 km2. Therefore, it was concluded that our global 30 m impervious-surface dynamic dataset is an accurate and promising product and could provide vital support in monitoring regional or global urbanization as well as in related applications.

	abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google’s computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the “big picture” of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a processing chain for the derivation of global Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Fraction Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Canopy water content (CWC) maps from 15-years of MODIS data exploiting the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The retrieval chain is based on a hybrid method inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model (RTM) with Random forests (RF) regression. A major feature of this work is the implementation of a retrieval chain exploiting the GEE capabilities using global and climate data records (CDR) of both MODIS surface reflectance and LAI/FAPAR datasets allowing the global estimation of biophysical variables at unprecedented timeliness. We combine a massive global compilation of leaf trait measurements (TRY), which is the baseline for more realistic leaf parametrization for the considered RTM, with large amounts of remote sensing data ingested by GEE. Moreover, the proposed retrieval chain includes the estimation of both FVC and CWC, which are not operationally produced for the MODIS sensor. The derived global estimates are validated over the BELMANIP2.1 sites network by means of an inter-comparison with the MODIS LAI/FAPAR product available in GEE. Overall, the retrieval chain exhibits great consistency with the reference MODIS product (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.54 m2/m2 and ME = 0.03 m2/m2 in the case of LAI, and R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.09 and ME = 0.05 in the case of FAPAR). The analysis of the results by land cover type shows the lowest correlations between our retrievals and the MODIS reference estimates (R2 = 0.42 and R2 = 0.41 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) for evergreen broadleaf forests. These discrepancies could be attributed mainly to different product definitions according to the literature. The provided results proof that GEE is a suitable high performance processing tool for global biophysical variable retrieval for a wide range of applications.},

Urbanized areas are often the strongest indicators of human interaction with the environment, and understanding how urban areas develop through remotely sensed data allows for more sustainable practices. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) leverages cloud computing services to provide analysis capabilities on over 40 years of Landsat data. As a remote sensing platform, its ability to analyze global data rapidly lends itself to being an invaluable tool for studying the growth of urban areas. Here we present (i) An approach for the automated extraction of urban areas from Landsat imagery using GEE, validated using higher resolution images, (ii) a novel method of validation of the extracted urban extents using changes in the statistical performance of a high resolution population mapping method. Temporally distinct urban extractions were classified from the GEE catalog of Landsat 5 and 7 data over the Indonesian island of Java by using a Normalized Difference Spectral Vector (NDSV) method. Statistical evaluation of all of the tests was performed, and the value of population mapping methods in validating these urban extents was also examined. Results showed that the automated classification from GEE produced accurate urban extent maps, and that the integration of GEE-derived urban extents also improved the quality of the population mapping outputs.},

	abstract = {All over the world, the rapid urbanization process is challenging the sustainable development of our cities. In 2015, the United Nation highlighted in Goal 11 of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) the importance to “Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. In order to monitor progress regarding SDG 11, there is a need for proper indicators, representing different aspects of city conditions, obviously including the Land Cover (LC) changes and the urban climate with its most distinct feature, the Urban Heat Island (UHI). One of the aspects of UHI is the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), which has been investigated through airborne and satellite remote sensing over many years. The purpose of this work is to show the present potential of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to process the huge and continuously increasing free satellite Earth Observation (EO) Big Data for long-term and wide spatio-temporal monitoring of SUHI and its connection with LC changes. A large-scale spatio-temporal procedure was implemented under GEE, also benefiting from the already established Climate Engine (CE) tool to extract the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat imagery and the simple indicator Detrended Rate Matrix was introduced to globally represent the net effect of LC changes on SUHI. The implemented procedure was successfully applied to six metropolitan areas in the U.S., and a general increasing of SUHI due to urban growth was clearly highlighted. As a matter of fact, GEE indeed allowed us to process more than 6000 Landsat images acquired over the period 1992–2011, performing a long-term and wide spatio-temporal study on SUHI vs. LC change monitoring. The present feasibility of the proposed procedure and the encouraging obtained results, although preliminary and requiring further investigations (calibration problems related to LST determination from Landsat imagery were evidenced), pave the way for a possible global service on SUHI monitoring, able to supply valuable indications to address an increasingly sustainable urban planning of our cities.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

The models are obtained by recursively partitioning the data space and fitting a simple prediction model within each partition. As a result, the partitioning can be represented graphically as a decision tree. Classification trees are designed for dependent variables that take a finite number of unordered values, with prediction error measured in terms of misclassification cost. Regression trees are for dependent variables that take continuous or ordered discrete values, with prediction error typically measured by the squared difference between the observed and predicted values.
