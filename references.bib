	abstract = {Small swath and coarse temporal resolution are the major limitations of high resolution satellite sensors for applications like monitoring large areas within limited period of time interval. In general, higher the spatial resolution smaller is the swath and coarser is the temporal resolution. In order to overcome this constraint, sensors are equipped with the capability to tilt from nominal nadir viewing to the required direction. When user specified area is difficult to acquire using Nadir viewing, Off-nadir viewing is exercised by tilting the platform/sensor to the required area.A study was carried out on off-nadir viewing effects in terms of radiometry and geometry using high resolution data. The parameters considered were (a) quality of resultant mosaic images (b) variations in the spatial resolutions (c) variations in the radiometry from the images acquired with various amount of tilts over different types of terrains. This paper aims to bring out the effects on the geometric and radiometric data quality and usability of value-added products generated from off-nadir high resolution data by analyzing existing {IRS}-Carto2S data. The observations drawn are useful for operating future {IRS} {HR} satellites to supply high quality products to the user community.},

	abstract = {Urban geographical maps are important to urban planning, urban construction, land-use studies, disaster control and relief, touring and sightseeing, and so on. Satellite remote sensing images are the most important data source for urban geographical maps. However, for optical satellite remote sensing images with high spatial resolution, certain inevitable factors, including cloud, haze, and cloud shadow, severely degrade the image quality. Moreover, the geometrical and radiometric differences amongst multiple high-spatial-resolution images are difficult to eliminate. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient procedure for generating high-resolution and high-quality seamless satellite imagery for large-scale urban regions. This procedure consists of image registration, cloud detection, thin/thick cloud removal, pansharpening, and mosaicking processes. Methodologically, a spatially adaptive method considering the variation of atmospheric scattering, and a stepwise replacement method based on local moment matching are proposed for removing thin and thick clouds, respectively. The effectiveness is demonstrated by a successful case of generating a 0.91-m-resolution image of the main city zone in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, using images obtained from the Chinese Beijing-2 and Gaofen-2 high-resolution satellites.},

	abstract = {The high-performance camera control systems carried aboard the {DigitalGlobe} {WorldView} satellites, {WorldView}-1 and {WorldView}-2, are capable of rapid retargeting and high off-nadir imagery collection. This provides the capability to collect dozens of multiangle very high spatial resolution images over a large target area during a single overflight. In addition, {WorldView}-2 collects eight bands of multispectral data. This paper discusses the improvements in urban classification accuracy available through utilization of the spatial and spectral information from a {WorldView}-2 multiangle image sequence collected over Atlanta, {GA}, in December 2009. Specifically, the implications of adding height data and multiangle multispectral reflectance, both derived from the multiangle sequence, to the textural, morphological, and spectral information of a single {WorldView}-2 image are investigated. The results show an improvement in classification accuracy of 27\% and 14\% for the spatial and spectral experiments, respectively. Additionally, the multiangle data set allows the differentiation of classes not typically well identified by a single image, such as skyscrapers and bridges as well as flat and pitched roofs.},

	abstract = {A fusion based seamless mosaic method for stitching remote sensing images is introduced in this paper. The proposed method focuses on one major problem in the process of mosaic: how to generate visually pleasant stitching result in the cases of misalignment, global and local intensity differences between images. First, two partially overlapped images are decomposed into high-frequency components and low-frequency components with Gaussian low-pass filter. Second, by considering the information characteristics contained in both separated components, different mosaic schemes are designed to accomplish stitching process accordingly. For the low-frequency components consisting of coarse shape and illumination information, two-dimension weighted blending rule is utilized to achieve smoothing transition. For the high-frequency components including rich details, an improved seam searching strategy based on dynamic programming is introduced. With the obtained stitching seam guiding the stitching process, visible structural break can be avoided. Finally, the mosaic result is produced by linearly composing both stitching results of different components together. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating seamless mosaic results without introducing any unexpected blurring or artifacts.},
