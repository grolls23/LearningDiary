    "section": "1.1 Summary",
    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing refers to methods of data collection whereby phenomena are observed and captured from afar. In the context of geospatial analysis, remote sensing refers to the capture and analysis of data pertaining to Earth’s surface from airborne and particularly spaceborne sensors.\n\n1.1.1 Sensor technologies and data collection\nThe medium of remote sensing is electromagnetic radiation. Remote sensing platforms monitor and record electromagnetic radiation reflected from the earth’s surface at specific wavelengths, including but not limited to the wavelengths of EMR which humans perceive as visible light.\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum - The Engineering Toolbox (n.d.)\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Active versus passive sensors\nSatellite sensors can be classified either as passive sensors or active sensors. A passive sensor only detects radiation reflected from the earth to the sensor and emits no energy of its own. For instance, an optical camera only captures light as it enters the aperture, emitting no energy of its own. An active sensor also captures energy from the surface, but the sensor is also the original source of that energy. For instance, a radar satellite emit radar pulses to the surface to capture their reflection (Earth Science Data Systems 2020).\n\n\n1.1.3 Types of Data Resolution\nRemote sensing platforms attempt to balance several key types of resolution to maximise the breadth and utility of the data collected.\nSpatial Resolution: Remote sensing data comes in the form of raster data, whereby the Earth’s surface is broken up into grid cells. Spatial resolution refers to the size of each of these grid cells. Sensors with higher spatial resolutions can measure EMR at a more granular level, i.e. in smaller grid cells.\nTemporal Resolution: Satellites travel over the Earth’s surface to collect data in regular and consistent orbits and revisit places at well-defined intervals. Satellites that capture more of Earth’s surface at a time (usually as a trade off with spatial resolution) rephotograph given points more frequently leading to a higher number of discrete observations over time.\nSpectral Resolution: EO Satellites monitor specific bands of the EM spectrum, that is, specific wavelengths of radiation. Satellites that monitor more bands at once are said to have higher spectral resolution.\nRadiometric Resolution: Sensors with high radiometric resolution can capture smaller differences in the intensity of radiation being reflected from Earth’s surface. To that end, they will report intensity results with higher precision.\n\n\n1.1.4 Atmospheric Interference\nA challenge of EO is ensuring that radiation reflected to the sensor accurately captures conditions at the surface. Radiation can be distorted in several ways such that data provides an inaccurate account of surface phenomena or is incapable capturing data at all. The most obvious interference is cloud cover, which blocks satellites from recording visual light from the surface.\nOther atmospheric phenomena distort readings, even when radiation can still travel from the surface to the satellite. For instance, the angle at which energy is reflected off the earth and the smoothness of the planet’s surface both cause light to reflect upward at different intensities in different directions. Additionally, light from the sun that never reaches Earth’s surface may instead by reflected off the atmosphere directly and be recorded by the sensor.\n\n\n1.1.5 End user data analysis\nThis week also briefly covered how end users of EO data can download and begin to manipulate remotely sensed data. Several platforms exist to process this sort of data, which is often large and computationally intensive to store and process. We learned how to download data from popular sensing platforms, namely ESA’s Sentinel and USGS’s Landsat. We also learned how to visualise and manipulate data bands in QGIS, and were introduced to SNAP, an application specifically designed to process Sentinel Data."

    "text": "1.2 Applications in Research\nThe field of remote sensing is vast, but one area in which I am particularly interested is the application of light emissions data from the DMSP and VIIRS satellite platforms to map the extent of urban development in polycentric urban entities known as megaregions. Originally pioneered by Richard Florida in his 2008 paper The Rise of the Mega-region (Florida, Gulden, and Mellander 2008), this method uses light emissions as a proxy for urban development to create a more data-driven method of identifying urban extents than municipal boundaries and is not as sensitive to how land cover is classified, as is the case with more traditional methods of identifying urban development from space (Woodall et al. 2023).\nMy particular interest in this research comes from a project I worked on during my undergraduate years where my research group identified satellite-driven approaches to defining megaregions as one of the fundamental methods in past literature and argued for an approach to defining urban boundaries by integrating VIIRS data with landcover data from Landsat and other remotely sensed built environment indicators, in a manner similar to Georg et al. in their analysis of the Boston-Washington corridor (Georg, Blaschke, and Taubenböck 2018).\n\n\n\nSuomi NPP Satellite with VIIRS Sensor - NASA Pace Gallery (n.d.)"

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nMy favourite part of this week’s class was learning about the motivations for and the trade-offs between different remote sensing platforms. Much of my experience with remote sensing has been in the context of a specific singular remotely sensed dataset, so I have not had the opportunity to compare different platforms (e.g. Landsat vs Sentinel) in the past or consider their respective resolutions.\nAdditionally, my prior exposure to remote sensing has been contained almost entirely to Google Earth Engine which has been implied in this first week of class to have unique advantages when it comes to data management and processing of EO data. I feel as if my experience in the first practical has validated that outlook to some degree, as I found downloading Landsat and Sentinel data and storing it on my local machine to be extremely cumbersome and computationally slow.\nProprietary platforms like SNAP, the ESA applications platform for Sentinel, introduce another layer of difficulty because of incompatibilities with recent MacOS updates. Although I’m excited to develop a stronger understanding of these tools for remote sensing, particularly R, I am looking forward to the return to Earth Engine."

    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis week, we discussed the pre-processing steps that allow us to turn raw remotely sensed data into a product which we can use for analysis. The processing requirements we described fell into two categories which will be detailed below.\n\n3.1.1 Corrections\nA number of types of distortions can occur which can alter where artefacts on the ground are placed in relation to each other or how radiation measured at the satellite differs from conditions at the surface. The main subcategories of distortions and primary methods to correct for them are briefly described here:\nGeometric Correction: The viewing angle of a satellite to the point on Earth’s surface being photographed can cause distortions in the resulting images, arising from inconsistent perspectives. Ideally, a satellite will be at the local zenith (directly above) of the point on Earth being imaged, but this is not always the case. Correcting for this specific type of distortion is known as orthorectification, where images are corrected to appear as if they were taken from nadir (straight down).\n\n\n\nIllustration of local zenith and satellite viewing angle - Space Aeronomy (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nCartosat-2 photos of the same hilly landscape taken at different viewing zenith angles - Kumari et al. (2019)\n\n\nSimilar distortions can occur as a result of the Earth’s topography or from the rotation of the earth moving the ground underneath the satellite as it orbits.\nTo apply a geometric correction, reference points (called ground control points) are matched between the collected image and a ‘ground truth’ dataset of the surface. From there, a linear regression model is generated and a geometric transformation applied to each point in the image.\nAtmospheric Correction: Interference from Earth’s atmosphere such as cloud cover atmospheric scattering, can cause radiation reflected from Earth’s surface to be distorted or obscured entirely. Atmospheric corrections can be either relative, in that they normalise pixels relative to other points in the image (e.g. a regression based on pseudo-invariant features, points which are likely to be consistent in their reflective properties), or absolute where atmospheric models are used to correct for specific atmospheric conditions.\n\n\n\nRelative Atmospheric Correction as applied to a true colour composite of Sentinel-2B imagery - NASA (2023)\n\n\nRadiometric Calibration: Although not image ‘correction’, radiometric calibration refers to converting the brightness of specific pixels (stored as a unitless digital number by the satellite) into radiance, which is a specific measure of radiative intensity.\nFortunately for professionals (or hobbyists) using remote sensing imagery, level two products can be downloaded for most sensor platforms. A level two product refers to data that has already been pre-processed to correct for many of the distortions described\n\n\n3.1.2 Data Joining\nBecause remote sensing data is collected and provided as sets of discrete images, it becomes important to join adjacent images together if an area of study falls across that boundary. Typically, remotely sensed images are feathered together, meaning a slight area of overlap is blended together to enable a seamless-looking transition, even between temporally distinct images. Typically, brightness values are normalised across the two images before this feathering occurs.\n\n\n\nIllustration of feathering images together - Li et al. (2020)\n\n\nThere are a number of other image enhancements one can do, including normalising brightness across bands or ‘stretching’ data across the entire range of digital numbers for a particular sensor to improve contrast. In the interest of brevity, I will omit a more detailed description here."

    "section": "3.2 Applications in Research",
    "text": "3.2 Applications in Research\nMuch of the processing described above is often more of a prerequisite to remote sensing work than the primary focus. With that said, a particular paper of interest I found used geometric distortions not as an image collection error to be corrected but as an additional source of data that adds height data to image collections of Atlanta, Georgia. (Longbotham et al. 2012). By creating what they refer to as a ‘multiangle image sequence’ of Atlanta Georgia using the WorldView-2 imaging satellite height data can be derived from these multi-image datasets, where only synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or LIDAR sensors have typically been used. From this, they used this height data to improve urban classification of the city by 27%.\nAnother paper I found interesting, Fusion based Seamless Mosaic for Remote Sensing Images, concerns the process of mosaicking, or stitching remotely sensed images together. In class we discussed the basic method of ‘feathering’ images together, whereby the region overlapped by the two images is converted into a weighted average of the two (with weights depending on which image each pixel is closer to). This paper proposes a method whereby images are decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components and processed independently. (Lu, Li, and Fu 2014) For low-frequency parts of images, which are smooth and continuous in nature, the aforementioned feathering effect is used. With that said, high-frequency components such as edges are preserved using a seam-stitching method that enables important structures to be best maintained while enabling smooth transitions of other features between each image."

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nPulling the curtain back, so to speak, on image processing was an enlightening process because my entire experience with remote sensing to date has dealt with pre-processed products that allowed me, as the end user, to bypass any concerns related to image collection entirely. It’s easy to conceptualise remotely sensed images as perfect and uninterrupted when Earth Engine is the window through which all of this data is viewed. Learning that atmospheric models are used to correct for specific distortions or how complex (and computationally expensive) some methods of mosaicking images can be gives me a greater appreciation for the power of the technology we’re applying when we use Landsat, Sentinel, or other EO data. Although I don’t see myself doing any work on image correction tools in the future, I think the context is critical."

    "text": "4.1 City of Choice & Policy Concern\nIn Week 4, we’ve been tasked with identifying a particular city and policy challenge it faces which could be investigated or solved with remote sensing.\nI haven’t yet ‘visited’ my hometown of Denver in my degree programme yet and seeing that it deals with a number of problems (many of which I’m particularly passionate about), I wanted to take a look.\nI want to talk not just about my problem of interest, urban heat effects, but also a particular contributing factor - high amounts of impervious surface area and specifically parking lots. Impervious surfaces are a global problem but America’s high automotive dependence and sprawling development patters have resulted in over 110 thousand square kilometres of surface area across the country (Frazer 2005). Most of the literature I’ve come across has talked about impervious surfaces focuses on either flooding (Feng, Zhang, and Bourke 2021) or heat island effects but I wish to focus on the latter.\n\n\n\nImpervious surfaces in Central Denver, as captured by the IKONOS sensor - Corporation (n.d.)\n\n\nCentral regions of Denver experience a heat island effect relative to its surroundings that ranges anywhere from 3.5 to 4.2C depending on the time of day and current season (Thunen 2013). Cooling the city is a critical goal, and the UN Environment Programme identifies heat mitigation in urban areas as a goal of immense importance in its ‘Beating the Heat’ handbook for cities. (Environment 2021). Denver itself indicates in its climate action plan, the city is likely to experience increasingly intense heat events in coming decades and that improving resilience along this dimension is critical (Denver 2018).\nAlthough it’s not possible to eliminate impervious surfaces entirely, one phenomena I noticed growing up in Denver was the massive number of vacant lots and unused parking lots which would remain unused for years on end. Large lots come with a number of environmental side effects and even when taken alone, contribute meaningfully to heat island effects (Davis et al. 2010). Additionally, research has shown that infill can have a positive effect on heat island effects (Helmholz et al. 2021)."

    "text": "4.2 Remote Sensing Dataset of Use\nThe good news for is that there exist a number of remotely sensed datasets which are extremely useful at identifying both impervious surface areas as well as the heat effects they generate. I would propose a method that applies the following datasets to be able to effectively identify areas of impervious surfaces, particularly parking lots, that are a) not part of existing structures and b) contributing to local heat effects:\n\n4.2.1 Land Surface Temperature (LST)\nAll active Landsat platforms collect data in the thermal infrared band at 30 metre resolution (Sayler 2023) and its use in studying urban heat island effects is extensive (Xu et al. 2023). In order to investigate urban heating at a higher spatial resolution, this platform is preferable to using meteorological data as has been done in the past in the context of Denver (Thunen 2013).\n\n\n\nLandsat 9 RGB and LST readings compared - Sayler (2023)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Impervious Surface Area (ISA)\nAlthough not a primary Landsat product like LST, Impervious Surface area can be derived from Landsat products and is available to researchers as a remote sensing product (Zhang et al. 2022). This data is also available at 30 metre resolution\n\n\n4.2.3 OSM Building Footprint Data\nAs impervious surfaces cover a large proportion of land in metropolitan Denver, using OSM Data could help narrow the search to identify disused lots or areas of impervious surfaces which could otherwise be altered.\n\n\n4.2.4 Taken Together…\nIt would be my hope that a combination of these datasets would allow policy-makers to identify the areas of Denver which most suffer from heat island effects and be able to search for nearby lots which might be eligible for infill or conversion into greenspace in order to help alleviate local effects.\nWith that said, impervious surfaces like parking lots are only one piece of the heat island puzzle and attempts to tackle heat islands at a city-level should absolutely apply other methods put forward by the ‘Beating the Heat’ manual such as heat-resilient infrastructure, street trees, and expanded greenspace, to name a few (Environment 2021)."

The policy approaches most often employed include building with high albedo materials, improving ground vegetation and shade trees, and green roofs and facades (Degirmenci et al. 2021). I think remotely sensed data provides an incredible opportunity to address root causes instead of mitigating effects, hence my interest in suggesting that it be used as a tool to identify areas of heat-insensitive development."

When looking around at what work had been done, I almost felt as if the whole span of applications had already been covered. In reality, it seems that a lot of approaches which feel like common sense are being ignored by a lot of municipalities. I don’t know if a city like Denver simply doesn’t have the bandwidth to further investigate heat effects, if it’s working hard through other means to fix them, or if it’s not concerned with them at all. Municipal documentation has been quite poor on that front.\nAdditionally, I find it surprising that so much of the work of urban heat resilience feels as if it’s concerned with mitigating the impact of heat than actually trying to lower the temperature. Shade shelters in particular feel like a bizarre first solution because, while I can see why they might be important and necessary in a number of circumstances, they won’t be any good at cooling cities down themselves like improved vegetation cover or reducing impervious surfaces would."

The number of specific tools and operations we learned about in Earth Engine is too great to share concisely in this learning diary format. For that reason, I will focus on what Earth Engine is and what makes it both unique and powerful as a spatial analysis platform.\n\n6.1.1 What is Earth Engine?\nGoogle Earth Engine is a high-performance geospatial analysis tool, with a particular focus on remote sensing, which was developed to allow researchers and other professionals to use high performance computing technologies in their work without requiring the requisite IT skill which has been required to take advantage of these resources in the past (Gorelick et al. 2017). The nature of remotely sensed data - raster datasets covering large expanses of the world’s surface - requires large computing resources to process at scale.\nEarth Engine satisfies these computational requirements by utilising a technique called parallel computing, wherein computationally intensive tasks are split into independent sub-tasks and processed simultaneously on multiple CPUs (Gorelick et al. 2017). The core idea behind the application’s architecture then, is that processing happens server-side instead of on a local machine as GIS programmes have typically required. Users interface with Earth Engine using JavaScript or Python-enabled libraries.\n\n\n\nThe basic Earth Engine architecture Gorelick et al. (2017)\n\n\nIn addition to reducing the local computational power required to efficiently utilise remotely sensed data, Earth Engine claims its other distinct advantage as that of data access and management. Google provides a ‘data catalogue’ which contains petabytes of the most commonly used (and arguably important) remotely sensed datasets available (Campos-Taberner et al. 2018). In addition to being constantly updated, this catalogue also includes historical readings from many satellite platforms which, when combined with the use of the aforementioned parallel processing paradigm, makes temporal analysis of RS data much easier (Campos-Taberner et al. 2018).\n\n\n\nSamples of Earth Engine’s Data Catalog Earth Engine (2019)"
